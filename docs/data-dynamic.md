# Add dynamic data
**Gridsome sites are static and serverless when deployed.**  To get real-time updates from a database (dynamic data) you'll need to fetch data from an external API after page load.

Best practice for this is to have a placeholder where the content will be added (A spinner or ) and then update that content when content is fetched. You can also just use static content as placeholder and then update it with dynamic data when it's fetched.

We recommend to use the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) package to add dynamic data to Gridsome. Install **axios** with `npm install axios --save` to get started.
